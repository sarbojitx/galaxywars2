1. Give Background(make it move downwards so it looks like the ship is moving)
2. Make enemy class(random spawning places,speed and life expectancy, firing rate and damage)
3. Make the playing character class(firing rate and damage,life expectancy, moving direction and velocity)
4. Figure out how to increase the difficulty level(increasing the firing rate of enemy, spawning more enemies, more asteroids)
